# Object Oriented Software Development Using C++ Workshop README

Welcome to the "Object Oriented Software Development Using C++" Workshop series! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of workshops completed during my course in OOP345. Each workshop showcases my knowledge and problem-solving skills on various C++ topics. Additionally, you'll find my reflections on each topic, providing insights into how I understood and tackled these challenges.

## Workshop Topics

### 1: Across Translation Units
- Explore the fundamentals of C++ and the Object-Oriented paradigm.
- Learn key terminology, understand namespaces, and get familiar with compilation and platforms.
- Delve into pre-processing directives and macros.

### 2: Containers
- Dive into the various types in C++, from fundamental to compound types.
- Work with classes, understand class relationships, and explore templates.
- Discover the concepts of composition, aggregation, and association.

### 3: Functions and Error Handling
- Learn about C++ expressions, operators, and functions.
- Simplify syntax, understand linkage, and explore recursive functions.
- Dive into pointers to functions, function objects, lambda expressions, and error handling with exceptions.

### 4: Move and Copy Semantics
- Explore the C++ memory model, raw pointers, C-style character strings, and smart pointers.
- Understand exclusive ownership with unique_ptr and shared ownership with shared_ptr.

### 5: Multi-Threading
- Get an introduction to multi-threading, processes, threads, and the future library.
- Explore thread local storage duration.

### 6: STL Algorithms
- Get hands-on with linked lists and the Standard Template Library (STL).
- Explore sequential containers, adapters, iterators, and algorithm libraries.

### 7: STL Containers
- Understand file stream objects, class hierarchy, file objects, binary access, and string classes.
- Navigate platform-dependent input/output.
- Compare C++11, C11 syntax, C++14, and C++17.

### 8: Smart Pointers
- Delve into exclusive ownership with unique_ptr and shared ownership with shared_ptr.

### 9: Templates
- Explore template syntax, specialization, ambiguities, and static members in class templates.
