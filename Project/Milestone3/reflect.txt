This programming project is a great way for us students to get hands-on experience with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
and learn how to use its concepts in real-world scenarios. All the necessary steps have been outlined clearly, from development 
through debugging and finally execution - it's an excellent way to put OOP into practice. The simulation demand that we consider 
objects, their interactions, and their behaviours within a rich yet dynamic system. What's more, there are clear expectations for 
us to meet which provide context for our endeavours. All in all, this project offers up a fantastic opportunity to deepen our understanding of OOP principles!

The project was challenging, especially the requirement to use STL algorithims instead of basic loops to follow these 
instructions i used  for_each to during the run and display function so that the operation will be applied to each element in the range.
ie. m_activeLine.begin() and m_activeLine.end(). 
I also used find_if and none_of in my constructor the first find_if function is used to find the workstation pointer in the vector stations that 
matches the item name in the record string i used it twice to find the current and the next station.
the 2nd find_if is used to find the first station in the assembly line in combination with none_of to check if there
is any workstation in the stations and if no such station is found it means that the current station is the first stations in the assembly line. 
The project was more complex than the workshops, because it gave me the opportunity as a student to develop my skills further and apply them to a more challenging problem.
