1.What I have Learned?
During this workshop, I practiced my understand of external and internal linkage.

External Linkage: 
	External linkage is a type of linkage that can be used not only in declared files 
	but also in other external modules.
	When declaring external linkage you use the keyword "extern". For example, in this workshop, 
	I declared the extern double g_taxrate; and extern double g_dailydiscount; variables in foodorder.h 
	file to use both as global variables. 

Internal Linkage:
	Meanwhile, internal linkage can only be used within declared bounds opposite to external linkage.
	Meaning internal linkage is not available to external files. Internal linkage is declared using the keyword "static".
	I used static keyword to implement the “counter” variable in the display function. 
	Because I had to keep track of how many times the display function was called and increasing its value every time. 
	Because of using the static keyword the variables value was able to stay even after the function went out of scope.

2.Changes from part 1 to part 2.
	The changes that I implemented in this workshop for part 2 was that to make the food description or for my instance 
	"food" dynamically allocated. In order to do this I made a temporary local variable of size 60 fDesc or short for foodDescription
	to store the istream input retrieved. I then created a void return function called setFood which takes in fDesc to dynamically 
	allocate memory to food depending on its size inorder to check its size i stored its value in a local variable called length by 
	int length = strlen(g_Desc) and then dynamically allocating memory to food with this length food = new chart[length + 1]
	after this you can either just go strcpy(food,g_Desc) or create a loop inorder to copy all members of g_Desc char array to 
	food char array. I also made sure to create a copy constructor and a Destructor.
